      Operation Give Back is a volunteer match site catered to students. This
      Girls Who Code community service project aims to encourage and foster
      youth involvement by connecting students to youth-friendly opportunities.

  Operation Give Back was built following Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial. The
  Rails web application marks my introduction to responsive and mobile-friendly
  UX/UI design. For this project, I used Bootstrap to create a clean, youthful,
  and appealing design within a tight schedule.
