      Solisles is a virtual pet site that aims to combine elements of traditional
      "adoptable sites" with a rich setting, unique ideas, and cute animated art.
      The site is currently undergoing alpha testing.

  Solisles began around 2009 as a small site hosted on a pet site maker.
  When the site maker closed around 2010, the project was continued using the
  Mysidia Adoptables script. This site has undergone numerous code, graphics,
  and brand renovations.

  After many years of handling the site's design, technical, and administrative
  challenges, Solisles became the platform on which I developed most of my
  programming and digital art skills. While the old site has become outdated in
  comparision to the standards I adhere to today, the experience gained over the
  course of the project continues to influence my work and design philosophy.
