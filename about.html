<h1>About Gernene</h1>

<p>
  Hi there! My name is Gernene Tan. You may also recognize me as Hwona (my pen
  name). I'm a high school junior who's looking to study web design, cyber
  security, and computer science. I started creating websites and digital art
  seven years ago - and I have to say that I love what I do!
</p>

<p>
  As a young girl, I was fascinated by the idea of utilizing code to add
  a whole new layer of depth and interaction to my artistic creations. I have
  since worked with HTML/CSS, PHP and MySQL, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, Python,
  and Java - Not to mention that I continue to learn more! My various projects
  range from simple static pages to full-blown ecommerce sites, giving me a wide
  range of experience with different programming languages, tools, and platforms.
</p>

<p>
  Today, my goal is to develop my design, technical, and business skillsets to
  maximize the quality of my work and the efficiency of my service. A learning
  student, I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities that pass my way. Do
  take a look around my portfolio and ask any questions...
</p>

<p>And remember me when you hunt for your next web designer!</p>
