    <h1>About Gernene</h1>

    <p>
      Hi there! My name is Gernene Tan. I combine computer science with aesthetic appeal to create innovative products.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became interested in computing and design when I was young. I loved online game graphics and taught myself basic programming and digital art when I discovered that I could make my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I've developed projects ranging from simple static sites to full-blown ecommerce apps. In my free time, I enjoy creative writing, illustration, and caterpillars!
