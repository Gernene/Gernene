Hi everyone!

My name is Gernene. I'm starting this blog, The Tangerine Peel, to explore design and technical ideas while providing support and resources for creators.

The name "Tangerine Peel" is both a play on my name (Gernene Tan) and a reference to analysis and deeper understanding (peeling away the orange skin).

Throughout my development as a programmer and designer, I've learned many skills/tricks that I sometimes wish I'd picked up on sooner. Much of the guidance I found easily available catered to individuals who were usually more experienced and specialized.

My writing aims to examine the worlds of art, design, and technology through the curious eyes of a younger, less certain individual. Join me on my personal journey as we learn and grow together.
