desc: Want to promote your work? Just looking for inspiration? Check out this list of collective Instagram accounts!
---

As a major advertising platform, Instagram is a great place for digital designers and developers to showcase their work. I decided to compile a list of collective Instagram accounts that feature app/web designs, interfaces, and graphics. Even if you don't feel like sharing your creations, these can be great repositories of inspiration!

Note: I plan to update this list accordingly, but do note publishing/last updated dates!

<h2>What are collective accounts?</h2>
Unlike accounts created to showcase an individual's work, collective accounts usually source content from many different designers and artists. To have their work featured on these collective accounts, designers may be asked to:

- Use/purchase a product the account is promoting
- DM or email the account
- Use a specific hashtag when they post a design they want featured
- Tag the account
