<H3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Absurdism, one of the most exciting and =
creative=20
movements in the modern theater, is a term applied to a particular type =
of=20
realistic drama which has absorbed theater audiences and critics for the =
past=20
three decades. One specific area, appropriately labeled "Theatre of the =
Absurd"=20
by the American critic Martin Esslin in the 1960's, offers its audience =
an=20
existentialist point of view of the outside world and forces them to =
consider=20
the meaning of their existence in a world where there appears to be no =
true=20
order or meaning. Inching ever closer to a realistic representation of =
life, the=20
evolution of absurdist drama from Samuel Beckett to Tom Stoppard brings =
a new=20
focus to absurdism and expands the role of philosophy and metaphor in =
theatrical=20
drama.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before discussing the ways in which the Theatre =
of the=20
Absurd has evolved, it is beneficial to understand where and how it =
developed.=20
Many theater historians and critics label Alfred Jarry's French play, =
Ubu Roi as=20
the earliest example of Theatre of the Absurd. Absurdism also has =
origins in=20
Shakespearean drama, particularly through the influence of the Commedia=20
dell'Arte. The current movement of absurdism, however, emerged in France =
after=20
World War II, as a rebellion against the traditional values and beliefs =
of=20
Western culture and literature. It began with the existentialist writers =
like=20
Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus and eventually included other writers =
such as=20
Eugene Ionesco, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Jean Genet, Edward Albee, =
and=20
Harold Pinter, to name a few. Its rules are fairly simple: 1.) There is =
often no=20
real story line; instead there is a series of "free floating images" =
which=20
influence the way in which an audience interprets a play. 2.) There is a =
focus=20
on the incomprehensibility of the world, or an attempt to rationalize an =

irrational, disorderly world. 3.) Language acts as a barrier to =
communication,=20
which in turn isolates the individual even more, thus making speech =
almost=20
futile. In other words, absurdist drama creates an environment where =
people are=20
isolated, clown-like characters blundering their way through life =
because they=20
don't know what else to do. Oftentimes, characters stay together simply =
because=20
they are afraid to be alone in such an incomprehensible world. Despite =
this=20
negativity, however, absurdism is not completely nihilistic. Martin =
Esslin=20
explains: the recognition that there is no simple explanation for all =
the=20
mysteries of the world, that all previous systems have been =
oversimplified and=20
therefore bound to fail, will appear to be a source of despair only to =
those who=20
still feel that such a simplified system can provide an answer. The =
moment we=20
realize that we may have to live without any final truths the situation =
changes;=20
we may have to readjust ourselves to living with less exulted aims and =
by doing=20
so become more humble, more receptive, less exposed to violent =
disappointments=20
and crises of conscious - and therefore in the last resort happier and =
better=20
adjusted people, simply because we then live in closer accord with =
reality.=20
(Kepos 384)=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, the goal of absurdist drama is not =
solely to=20
depress audiences with negativity, but an attempt to bring them closer =
to=20
reality and help them understand their own "meaning" in life, whatever =
that may=20
be. Samuel Beckett's understanding of this philosophy best characterizes =
how we=20
should perceive our existence as he says, "Nothing is more real than =
Nothing."=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Building on these components of absurdism, we =
can now=20
proceed to analyze the way in which absurdist drama has evolved. The two =

dramatists who best reveal this process of evolution are Samuel Beckett =
and Tom=20
Stoppard. Using Beckett as a starting point and Stoppard as an ending =
point, one=20
gets a small sense of the ways in which absurdist theater has changed =
and keeps=20
changing. In comparing and contrasting these two dramatists' works, =
specifically=20
changes in structure and metaphorical intent, the evolution of absurdism =

ventures beyond its original borders into a new and distinct realistic =
theater.=20
Of the three plays which clearly reveal this evolution, Samuel Beckett's =
Waiting=20
For Godot will be addressed first, followed by another one of his plays, =

Endgame, and finally a discussion of Tom Stoppard's play Rosencrantz and =

Guildenstern Are Dead. All of these plays metaphorically address the =
issue of=20
"ending" or "dying" and through such a focus offer us a clear example of =
one way=20
in which absurdism has evolved.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beckett's most popular absurdist play, Waiting =
For=20
Godot, is one of the first examples critics point to when talking about =
the=20
Theatre of the Absurd. Written and first performed in French in 1954, =
Godot had=20
an enormous impact on theatergoers due to its strange and new =
conventions.=20
Consisting of an essentially barren set, with the exception of a =
virtually=20
leafless tree in the background, clown-like tramps, and highly symbolic=20
language, Godot challenges its audience to question all of the old rules =
and to=20
try to make sense of a world that is incomprehensible. At the heart of =
the play=20
is the theme of "coping" and "getting through the day" so that when =
tomorrow=20
comes we can have the strength to continue.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Structurally, Godot is a two-act play which is =
primarily=20
cyclical. It begins with two lonely tramps on a roadside who are =
awaiting the=20
arrival of a figure referred to as Godot and ends with the same premise. =
Many=20
critics have concluded that Act Two is simply a repeat of Act One. In =
other=20
words, Vladimir and Estragon may forever be "waiting for Godot." We are =
never=20
given an answer to their predicament. As an audience, we can only watch =
them do=20
the same things, listen to them say the same things, and accept the fact =
that=20
Godot may or may not come. Much like them, we are stuck in a world where =
our=20
actions dictate our survival. We may search for an answer or a meaning =
to our=20
existence, but we most likely will never find it. Anthony Jenkins =
writes, "there=20
can be no answers; Godot may or may not exist and may or may not arrive; =
we know=20
no more about him than do Vladimir and Estragon"(40). Thus, this play is =

structurally arranged in such a way as to make us believe that Godot =
will=20
probably never come, and that we must accept the uncertainty of life.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The two main characters, Vladimir and Estragon, =
spend=20
their days reliving their past trying to make sense of their existence, =
and even=20
contemplate suicide as a form of escape. As characters, however, they =
are the=20
prototypical absurdist figures who remain detached from the audience. =
They=20
essentially lack identities and their vaudeville mannerisms, =
particularly when=20
it comes to contemplating their suicides, has a more comic effect on the =

audience than a tragic one. This is perhaps best observed in the =
beginning scene=20
of the play when they contemplate hanging themselves:=20
<P>VLADIMIR: What do we do now?=20
<P>ESTRAGON: Wait.=20
<P>VLADIMIR: Yes, but while waiting.=20
<P>ESTRAGON: What about hanging ourselves?=20
<P>VLADIMIR: Hmm. It'd give us an erection.=20
<P>ESTRAGON: (highly excited). An erection! (12)=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What follows is a discussion of who should hang=20
themselves first. Vladimir suggests Estragon go first since he is =
lighter and=20
therefore won't break the bough and leave the other one alone and alive. =
The=20
conversation continues:=20
<P>ESTRAGON: (with effort). Gogo light- bough not break- Gogo dead. Didi =
heavy-=20
bough break- Didi alone. Whereas-=20
<P>VLADIMIR: I hadn't thought of that.=20
<P>ESTRAGON: If it hangs you it'll hang anything.=20
<P>VLADIMIR: But am I heavier than you?=20
<P>ESTRAGON: So you tell me. I don't know. There's an even chance. Or =
nearly.=20
<P>VLADIMIR: Well? What do we do?=20
<P>ESTRAGON: Don't let's do anything. It's safer.=20
<P>VLADIMIR: Let's wait and see what he says.=20
<P>ESTRAGON: Who?=20
<P>VLADIMIR: Godot.=20
<P>ESTRAGON: Good idea. (13)=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This comical scene, replete with the image of =
death,=20
ends up making the audience laugh rather than take the two tramps =
seriously.=20
And, the fact that Estragon and Vladimir choose to not hang themselves =
suggests=20
a much more existentialist, absurdist view of death and a less tragic =
one.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What remains archetypal in Godot concerning the=20
absurdist metaphor is the way in which each character relies on the =
other for=20
comfort, support, and most of all, meaning. Vladimir and Estragon =
desperately=20
need one another in order to avoid living a lonely and meaningless life. =
The two=20
together function as a metaphor for survival. Like the characters who =
proceed=20
and follow them, they feel compelled to leave one another, but at the =
same time=20
compelled to stay together.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the end of Act One, Vladimir and Estragon =
discuss=20
their partnership, saying:=20
<P>ESTRAGON: Wait! (He moves away from Vladimir.) I sometimes wonder if =
we=20
wouldn't have been better off alone, each one for himself. (He crosses =
the stage=20
and sits down on the mound.) We weren't made for the same road.=20
<P>VLADIMIR: (without anger). It's not certain. <BR>ESTRAGON: No, =
nothing is=20
certain.=20
<P>Vladimir slowly crosses the stage and sits down beside Estragon.=20
<P>VLADIMIR: We can still part if you think it would be better.=20
<P>Silence.=20
<P>ESTRAGON: No, it's not worth while now.=20
<P>Silence. (35-36)=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The same conversation takes place again at the =
end of=20
Act Two:=20
<P>ESTRAGON: Didi.=20
<P>VLADIMIR: Yes.=20
<P>ESTRAGON: I can't go on like this.=20
<P>VLADIMIR: That's what you think.=20
<P>ESTRAGON: If we parted that might be better for us.=20
<P>VLADIMIR: We'll hang ourselves to-morrow. (Pause). Unless Godot =
comes.=20
<P>ESTRAGON: And if he comes?=20
<P>VLADIMIR: We'll be saved. (61)=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They consider parting, but, in the end, never =
actually=20
part. Andrew Kennedy explains these rituals of parting saying, "each is =
like a=20
rehearsed ceremony, acted out to lessen the distance between time =
present and=20
the ending of the relationship, which is both dreaded and desired"(57).=20
Therefore, Vladimir and Estragon's inability to leave each other is just =
another=20
example of the uncertainty and frustration they feel as they wait for an =

explanation of their existence. For them and for us, death seems forever =
on the=20
horizon, and therefore ending becomes "an endless process"(Kennedy 48).=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Samuel Beckett's other absurdist play, Endgame, =
carries=20
on this same kind of thinking but is much more tragic and serious in its =

metaphor for death than Godot. Like Godot, there is no apparent action =
in the=20
play. Hamm and Clov, the two main figures, are even more isolated than =
Vladimir=20
and Estragon. Confined to a small, bare room, the blind and disabled =
Hamm=20
postulates on the subjects of life and death, while interacting with and =

depending on his servant/son Clov to fill in meaning where there appears =
to be a=20
void. Resembling Estragon and Vladimir are Hamm's parents Nagg and Nell, =
who are=20
confined to trash bins at the front left of the stage. They, like the =
two=20
tramps, exchange memories of a once coherent world and spend their time =
eating=20
pap and biscuits. However, unlike Godot, Endgame is not absolutely =
cyclical.=20
Instead, it emphasizes only one cycle and works its way toward some kind =
of=20
ending, or in other words, has the vague feeling of a finale. Even =
though death=20
does not come at the end of Endgame, there is a strong sense that it is =
nearby=20
and the waiting will not be as long, as suggested by the chess-like =
title.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Godot, Endgame's comic quality keeps it =
from being=20
too tragic in its metaphoric message. Sarah Lawall writes, "The =
characters=20
popping out of ashcans, the jerky, repetitive motions with which Clov =
carries=20
out his master's commands, and the often obscene vaudeville patter =
accompanied=20
by appropriate gestures, all provide a comic perspective that keeps =
Endgame from=20
sinking into tragic despair"(2468). However, the seriousness with which =
Hamm=20
talks about death and ending in his soliloquies is not entirely undercut =
by the=20
comedy. References to death are abundantly scattered throughout the =
play. While=20
Godot emphasizes survival no matter what the cost, Endgame is doing =
virtually=20
the same, but with a much more serious, empathetic tone. The audience is =
still=20
somewhat detached from the characters on stage, but at the same time =
there is=20
more of a feeling of sorrow for the characters in Endgame than Godot. As =
Lawall=20
suggests, this may have something to do with the fact that Endgame =
"describes=20
what it is like to be alive, declining toward death in a world without=20
meaning"(2469). Jacques Lemarchand describes it another way, "this may =
be the=20
very game we play all the time, without ever believing it to be as close =
as it=20
is to its end"(Modern and Contemporary Drama 484).=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The metaphor for death or coming to the "end" of =

something is apparent in the very first lines of the play as Clov =
states,=20
"Finished, it's finished, nearly finished, it must be nearly =
finished"(456).=20
Hamm's response to Clov's ramblings as he awakens is "Me to play." =
Hamm's=20
reluctance to die, however, follows shortly after as he says, "And yet, =
I=20
hesitate to end. Yes, there it is, it's time it ended and yet I hesitate =
to- to=20
end"(457). This beginning scene suggests something that is quite common =
in most=20
absurdist plays, the unwillingness to end or to die. Yet, there remains =
a=20
struggling to understand death, to give it some meaning so that life has =

meaning. So as not to completely depress his audience, Beckett begins =
the play=20
with a fairly comical musing on death. For example, two scenes in the =
first four=20
pages concerning death are actually quite funny. Clov and Hamm discuss =
the=20
connection between food and death saying:=20
<P>HAMM: I'll give you nothing more to eat.=20
<P>CLOV: Then we'll die.=20
<P>HAMM: I'll give you just enough to keep you from dying. You'll be =
hungry all=20
the time.=20
<P>CLOV: Then we won't die. (458)=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A few lines later Hamm implores, "Why don't you =
kill=20
me?" to which Clov replies, "I don't know the combination of the =
cupboard"(458).=20
Both of these are meant to make the audience chuckle just a bit. On the =
other=20
hand, Beckett juxtaposes a conversation between Nagg and Nell shortly =
after,=20
which takes a more serious view of unhappiness and longing for death. It =

involves more introspection and a clearer understanding of the =
situation. After=20
listening to Nagg's joke, Nell responds:=20
<P>NELL(without lowering her voice): Nothing is funnier than =
unhappiness, I=20
grant you that. But-=20
<P>NAGG(shocked): Oh!=20
<P>NELL: Yes, yes, it's the most comical thing in the world. And we =
laugh, with=20
a will, in the beginning. But it's always the same thing. Yes, it's like =
the=20
funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we =
don't laugh=20
anymore. (461)=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly, the theme of the play resides in =
Nell's=20
concluding words about life and meaninglessness. Nevertheless, the =
comedic=20
aspects of the play help the actors and the audience deal with the =
potentially=20
negative issue about death in a more positive, cathartic way.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another absurdist element that is present in =
Godot and=20
is also reiterated in Endgame is the love/hate, dependent relationship =
of Hamm=20
and Clov. Like their predecessors Vladimir and Estragon, Hamm and Clov =
need each=20
other emotionally, and more so, physically. Hamm's disabled state makes =
him need=20
Clov more than Clov needs Hamm, but Clov needs Hamm simply because =
Hamm's home=20
is the only home he has, and even if he did leave there is no place for =
him to=20
go in the void which exists outside. Kennedy's rituals of parting exist =
in this=20
play, as well, and perhaps mean more than they do in Godot. Whereas in =
Godot,=20
Vladimir and Estragon may have the luxury of meeting others should they =
choose=20
to leave one another, Hamm and Clov do not appear to have that option in =

Endgame. An early conversation establishes this:=20
<P>HAMM: Why do you stay with me?=20
<P>CLOV: Why do you keep me?=20
<P>HAMM: There's no one else.=20
<P>CLOV: There's nowhere else. (458)=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Midway though the play, a similar reference to =
leaving=20
is brought up again:=20
<P>CLOV: So, you all want me to leave you.=20
<P>HAMM: Naturally.=20
<P>CLOV: Then I'll leave you.=20
<P>HAMM: You can't leave us.=20
<P>CLOV: Then I won't leave you. (466)=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, by the end of the play, we know that Clov =
will not=20
leave Hamm. He has had plenty of chances to do so, just as Vladimir and =
Estragon=20
have, but in the end he never does. Clov even says he will never leave =
in one of=20
his more contemplative speeches about life with Hamm. Standing at the =
door he=20
says:=20
<P>CLOV: I say to myself- sometimes, Clov, you must learn to suffer =
better than=20
that if you want them to weary of punishing you- one day, I say to =
myself-=20
sometimes, Clov, you must be there better than that if you want them to =
let you=20
go- one day. But I feel too old, and too far, to form new habits. Good =
it'll=20
never end, I'll never go. (479-480)=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, just as we know that Clov will not leave =
Hamm, Hamm=20
also realizes Clov will not leave him. The closing lines of the play =
echo this=20
acceptance as Hamm states, "Old stancher! You...remain" (481). So, while =
Godot=20
and Endgame are alike in the absurdist methods they use, they differ in =
their=20
level of metaphorical importance. Clearly, Endgame is a beginning to =
move beyond=20
absurdism, in that, where Beckett only hints at the inevitability of =
death in=20
Godot, it becomes more obvious in Endgame that death is inching ever =
closer and=20
is within our sights. This realization, in turn, harkens back to =
Esslin's=20
comment on the function of absurdity to help us "live in closer accord =
with=20
reality." Tom Stoppard will complete this eventual evolution, or process =
toward=20
death, in his absurd play, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Obviously influenced by Beckett, Stoppard's play =

certainly imitates Godot and Endgame. Like the two previous plays, =
Stoppard's=20
main characters, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, are two individuals who =
find=20
themselves in the center of an incomprehensible world. While Godot is =
"about the=20
uncertainty and frustration felt by Didi and Gogo in their interminable =
waiting=20
in limitless time, Stoppard's is about the uncertainty felt by =
Rosencrantz and=20
Guildenstern in trying to understand the origin and meaning of events =
which they=20
come to realize are carrying them to their deaths"(Duncan 59). What =
essentially=20
makes them different is while the characters in Godot wait, but never =
change,=20
the characters in Rosencrantz have to change.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Michael Hinden suggests, Stoppard's play is =
an=20
example of his ability "to absorb and to work through Beckett, not to =
get around=20
him"(404). So, it follows that Stoppard uses the absurdist template to =
build on=20
and go beyond. In Rosencrantz, Stoppard introduces us to an absurd =
world, but a=20
world nevertheless which possesses some type of order. Unlike the =
previous=20
plays, there are rules that must be followed. Godot and Endgame =
subscribe to the=20
belief that man has no role to play, and thus can only make up reasons =
for=20
existence. Rosencrantz, however, postulates that man plays a defined =
role, but=20
it is a role that is unfathomable. Victor Cahn supports this difference, =

explaining that Stoppard "brings his characters into a new world, one =
where=20
elements of absurdity are disguised under a mask of order and reason =
worn by a=20
society which Stoppard has made us come to see as perhaps absurd =
itself"(64).=20
So, Stoppard uses Beckett's absurdist tendencies as a model, but goes =
beyond the=20
traditional absurdist play in several ways.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first thing that Stoppard does that differs =
from=20
Beckett is he provides his characters with a stronger sense of identity. =

Vladimir and Estragon are nobodies in Godot. We don't know much about =
them, as a=20
whole. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, on the other hand, become more real =
to us.=20
In including the Hamlet sub-play, Stoppard gives them an identity, a =
meaning in=20
their incomprehensible existence. They are Elizabethan courtiers who =
have been=20
summoned to Elsinore to glean what afflicts Prince Hamlet. Here, =
Stoppard is=20
playing with the audience's pre-knowledge of the tragedy of Hamlet. =
Therefore,=20
when they view this play, they already know the outcome of the play =
based on=20
their knowledge of Hamlet or their understanding of the play's title. =
This, in=20
turn, makes the characters of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern more =
realistic and=20
more subject to the audience's pity, thereby breaking the distance =
between=20
audience and actor. In this manner, Rosencrantz also differs by having a =

structure which is linear, not cyclical. Stoppard's play has a definite =
end, a=20
movement toward death which does come and is certain. Joseph Duncan =
explains,=20
"the courtiers become part of a pattern of events- whose cause or =
purpose they=20
do not understand- which they cannot or will not escape and which both =
gives=20
them their only identity and carries them to their deaths"(65).=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Hamm in Endgame, Rosencrantz and =
Guildenstern are=20
extremely preoccupied with contemplating their deaths. What is unique =
about=20
Rosencrantz and signifies the final evolution of the absurdist view is=20
Stoppard's abrupt answering of the absurdist question: What is the =
meaning of=20
life or death in an irrational world? The answer is simply the =
realization that=20
death comes to all living things and is something that can never be =
understood=20
or explained, but something that simply is. And, unlike Godot and =
Endgame, death=20
does come at the end of the play. The end result remains a metaphorical =
treatise=20
on the way in which we perceive death and how we condition ourselves to =
believe=20
in its existence.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In his essay, "Theatre at the Limit," John =
Perlette=20
rightly points out that Stoppard "knows that direct and immediate access =
to the=20
reality of death is simply beyond the capacity of his audience" and that =
the=20
only solution is to present that "illusory spectacles of death are the =
only=20
kinds in which we are prepared to believe"(666). This philosophy is best =

represented through the character of The Player, and it is The Player's =
job to=20
convince Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that this is the case. Ideally,=20
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern represent the concept of Everyman, or put =
more=20
simply, they are no different from us. When their own deaths are =
presented to=20
them two different times, they blindly do not see what they are headed =
for=20
because the reality of what must be is too close to realism for them. =
The same=20
is true for modern man. We accept only what we can believe in, and to =
believe in=20
death is to believe in our own absence of presence. In more realistic =
terms, we=20
see death as a tragic end which metaphorically symbolizes "an abrupt =
exit from=20
one's own drama into a place incomprehensibly other"(Jenkins 43). =
Stoppard's=20
ultimate conclusion on this subject is that we as human beings will be =
better=20
off if we learn to accept that death is just as incomprehensible as =
life, and=20
the only way to psychological happiness must come from dismissing social =

conventions and beliefs of death and reconciling it with the ultimate =
view that=20
we live in a world which defies reason and meaning.=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike Vladimir and Estragon, Rosencrantz and=20
Guildenstern do much more than wait for something to happen to them. In =
fact,=20
they are constantly being bombarded with attention, which tends to =
irritate them=20
on several occasions. They have come to realize that their actions are =
somehow=20
connected to a larger force, which may or may not have control of their =
actions.=20

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consistently throughout the play, Rosencrantz =
and=20
Guildenstern test this theory of control. When they first arrive in =
Elsinore (or=20
in the Hamlet play) they contemplate what they should do:=20
<P>ROS: Shouldn't we do something something- constructive?=20
<P>GUIL: What did you have in mind?. . . A short, blunt human pyramid. . =
.?=20
<P>ROS: We could go.=20
<P>GUIL: Where?=20
<P>ROS: After him.=20
<P>GUIL: Why? They've got us placed now- if we start moving around, =
we'll all be=20
chasing each other all night.=20
<P>ROS (at footlights): How very intriguing! (Turns.) I feel like a =
spectator-=20
an appalling business. The only thing that makes it bearable is the =
irrational=20
belief that somebody interesting will come on in a minute. . .=20
<P>GUIL: See anyone?=20
<P>ROS: No. You?=20
<P>GUIL: No. (At footlights.) What a fine persecution- to be kept =
intrigued=20
without ever quite being enlightened. . .(Pause.) We've had no practice. =

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the Hamlet play continues, they begin to feel =

themselves being "caught up" in the action. People are coming at them =
from all=20
sides, and they feel they are being pulled in all different directions. =
In Godot=20
and Endgame, this is certainly not the case. Stoppard hints that they do =
have=20
the luxury of "choice" and that there are a few moments where they can =
escape=20
from their predicament. Guildenstern recognizes this when they are on =
the boat=20
taking Hamlet to England saying, "Free to move, speak, extemporize, and =
yet. We=20
have not been cut loose. . . we may seize the moment, toss it around =
while the=20
moments pass, a short dash here, an explanation there, but we are =
brought full=20
circle"(101). Eventually this theorizing continues until the end of the =
play=20
when they realize their situation as Guildenstern's last lines question =
the=20
validity of choice: "There must have been a moment, at the beginning, =
where we=20
could have said- no. But somehow we missed it"(125). And the absurdity =
of the=20
situation is heightened even more when he continues, "Well, we'll know =
better=20
next time"(126).=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Getting back to the issue of death, and the =
certain=20
uncertainty of it, Stoppard sets up an argument between The Player and=20
Guildenstern to show that just as there are two levels of life there are =
two=20
levels of death: stage death and real death. As The Player is narrating =
the=20
dumb-show to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Guildenstern asks the Player =
what the=20
actors know about death. The Player tells him that it is "what they do=20
best"(83). The conversation continues:=20
<P>GUIL(fear, derision): Actors! The mechanics of cheap melodrama! That =
isn't=20
death! (More quickly). You scream and choke and sink to your knees, but =
it=20
doesn't bring death home to anyone- it doesn't catch them unawares and =
start the=20
whisper in their skulls that says- "One day you are going to die." (He=20
straightens up.) You die so many times; how can you expect them to =
believe in=20
your death?=20
<P>PLAYER: On the contrary, it's the only kind they do believe. They're=20
conditioned to it. . . Audiences know what to expect, and that is all =
they are=20
prepared to believe in.=20
<P>GUIL: No, no, no. . .you've got it all wrong. . .you can't act death. =
The=20
fact of it is nothing to do with seeing it happen- it's not gasps and =
blood and=20
falling about- that isn't what makes death. It's just a man failing to =
reappear,=20
that's all- now you see him, now you don't, that's the only thing that's =
real. .=20
. (83-84)=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the end of the play, still unconvinced by The =

Player's definition of death, Guildenstern loses his patience with The =
Player=20
and pulls his dagger on him, in an attempt to show him what "real" death =
is all=20
about:=20
<P>GUIL: I'm talking about death- and you've never experienced that. And =
you=20
cannot act it. You die a thousand casual deaths- with none of that =
intensity=20
which squeezes out life. . .and no blood runs cold anywhere. Because =
even as you=20
die you know that you will come back in a different hat. But no one gets =
up=20
after death- there is no applause- there is only silence and some =
second-hand=20
clothes, and that's- death- (123)=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Guildenstern then proceeds to stab The Player =
who falls=20
to the ground and dies. Thinking he has really killed The Player, =
Guildenstern=20
is satisfied with his argument that real death and stage death are not=20
congruent. However, he is denied this satisfaction because The Player =
gets up=20
and is applauded by the Tragedians for his very believable "act" of =
dying. The=20
Player reemphasizes, "What did you think? (Pause.) You see, it is the =
kind they=20
do believe in- it's what is expected" (123). Like Rosencrantz and =
Guildenstern,=20
we as the audience are also convinced of The Player's death. As Perlette =

suggests, "we 'believe' because we do not believe"(667). So, as a =
result, we can=20
"'believe' by suspending our disbelief only if that disbelief is there =
to be=20
suspended in the first place"(667). This illusion is what The Player has =
been=20
trying to explain all along, and what Stoppard wants us to understand =
most about=20
his play. Therefore, as Cahn has suggested, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern =
are at=20
the end of their play "the ultimate victims of absurdity"(60).=20
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When we compare and contrast the plays Godot, =
Endgame,=20
and Rosencrantz, we can list many ways in which they are alike in their=20
absurdist tendencies and many ways in which they are different. What =
remains=20
essentially important is not so much that they are different, but the =
degree to=20
which they are different. Beckett's treatment of death as something to =
come,=20
something always on the horizon out of reach, is probably more happily=20
acceptable to the viewer than Stoppard's view. But despite the negative=20
connotations death holds, both Beckett and Stoppard use the metaphor of =
death to=20
help us understand how our lives are absurd and how, once we accept =
this, we can=20
be happier, healthier individuals. The evolution of absurdism is most =
clearly=20
represented by the degree to which Stoppard uses the linear metaphor of =
death to=20
bring us closer to his characters and closer to ourselves. He goes =
beyond=20
absurdism by breaking the distance between the audience and the actors. =
We feel=20
more for his characters and we sympathize with their inability to =
completely=20
change their fates, as we ourselves struggle with the same problem. =
Again, the=20
words of Martin Esslin come to mind, and the Theatre of the Absurd in =
all of its=20
intellectual complexities and intricacies helps us to see our role in =
life.=20
Esslin writes:=20
