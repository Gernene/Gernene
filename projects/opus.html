            <p>
                OPUS is a tech-powered private tuition company. I helped develop both its official marketing website and progress-tracking web app.

                One of OPUS' core value propositions is a money-back guarantee: Customers are refunded if their child/student does not show improvement. In order to measure and monitor student progress, OPUS tutees take a quiz at the end of every lesson. Previously, quiz scores were recorded in different Google Drive spreadsheets which became unwieldy to manage. Hence, we created a custom web app to give OPUS <strong>a better way to track and update student progress.</strong>

                I began this project by identifying potential users/stakeholders and creating actionable requirements. Some of the most important ones are summarized below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stakeholders:</strong> Admin/business owner, tutors, parents, students</li>
                <li>Parents can monitor their childrens' progress</li>
                <li>Tutors can record lesson information</li>
                <li>Admins can manage users including parents, tutors, students, and other admins</li>
                <li>Flag students who have "deproved"</li>
            </ul>

                Originally, an OPUS lead would find out about the company through a digital ad and schedule a consultation via phone call. During this call, an OPUS representative would discuss the lead's tuition needs and make arrangements for lesson scheduling.

            <p class="project-p">
                I made some simple user journey sketches to explore how this OPUS lead/customer might interact with a web app as well as what screens I'd need to design.

                I opted for a simple but modular design for OPUS after considering several factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Small team size</li>
                <li>Small and "contained" market size</li>
                <li>Need for flexibility to accomodate changing requirements and product needs</li>
                <li>Limit unecessary technical complexity, added frameworks</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="project-p">
                The OPUS web app consists of a React frontend which interfaces with the Typescript backend/server via a REST API. The server handles all business logic while retrieving data from the PostgreSQL database. A few diagrams taken from the technical documentation:

                OPUS was an opportunity for me to oversee the creation of a real business application from the database to the user interface. It gave me a better understanding of how different components fit together, affect design decisions, and challenged me to think more strategically when choosing what technologies/apporaches to use.
